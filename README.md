Coursework 1 for CM50258
Saturated Reverse Polish Notation
(SRPN) Calculator
Whilst performing some maintenance on a legacy system you find that it
makes use of a program called SRPN. SRPN is not documented and no
one seems to know who wrote it, so your boss tells you to rewrite it in
Python.

SRPN is a reverse polish notation calculator with the extra feature
that all arithmetic is saturated i.e. when it reaches the maximum value that
can be stored in a variable, it stays at the maximum rather than wrapping
around.

Your task is to write a program which matches the functionality
of SRPN as closely as possible. Note that this includes not adding
or enhancing existing features.

You have been provided with a repl.it link which allows you to run and
interact with the SRPN program. You should spend time inputting data
and observing the output to understand what the program does.

On the following pages we have provided four categories of tests:
• Single operations
• Multiple operations
• Saturation
• Obscure functionality
In each category we have provided example test data that you should input
and observe the output of. A good starting point in this coursework is to
write code that meets these tests and variations of the data.
